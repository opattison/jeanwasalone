## A "happy birthday" CSS-only animation hack

### (More than) inspired by [Thomas Was Alone](http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/)

This was a quick evening project that I put together to test out my CSS animation skills. No JavaScript or images were used in making this â€“ only CSS transforms and animations.

I loved the animations in the game *Thomas Was Alone* and wanted to see what parts were easy or difficult to emulate in quick and rough HTML and CSS. I also wanted to wish Jean happy birthday and I dislike paper greeting cards!

## Features

- Viewport-responsive typography in monologue boxes, just like in *Thomas*. I tried my best to emulate the clever writing of the game's narrator.
- Rendering of characters and backgrounds using CSS and typography.
- Museo Sans font (also from the titles and interface in the game).

## Limitations

- Non-optimized CSS everywhere!
- No full support for anything but desktop Chrome and Safari.
- Does not play well with mobile devices, unfortunately.
